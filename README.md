# Radiation Surface MLE Estimator

This repository owns only the 3-D surface maximum-likelihood estimator. Physical
acquisition, Geant4, detector/shield/obstacle physics, spectrum generation, and raw
MeasurementLog v2 publication are provided by the versioned
`rotating-shield-simulation-runtime` dependency.

## Online estimator

`OnlineMLESession` is the runtime-facing API. A controller passes each
`runtime.records.MeasurementRecord` only after the shared runtime has durably staged
it. The MLE buffers every shield-view record without fitting an incomplete station.
When the final view marks `station_complete`, it performs exactly one coarse
all-history warm fit for that measurement point and publishes the durable report.
The final call rebuilds the configured full-resolution map and uncertainty result.
The output is:

```text

└── final/

```

The class never generates observations and never writes a MeasurementLog. The runtime
controller retains this ordering:

```python
observation_session.step(action)  # runtime simulates and durably stages first
record = observation_session.writer.records[-1]
online_mle.receive_persisted(
    record,
    station_complete=action.station_complete,
)
```

For deterministic validation of the same online update path against an already
published runtime log:

```bash
uv run estimate-radiation-mle online-replay \
  --run-dir /path/to/measurement-log-v2 \
  --mle-config configs/mle/default_spectral.json \
  --output-dir /path/to/mle-online \
  --cpu --json
```

This command starts the live dashboard server by default and prints its URL before
the first station fit. The page refreshes from atomically published MLE snapshots;
it neither reads nor displays simulation truth. Use `--dashboard-port`,
`--dashboard-host`, and `--dashboard-public-host` for remote delivery. Set
`MLE_DASHBOARD_PUBLIC_HOST` when the externally reachable host should be discovered
from the environment. `--no-serve` keeps the static dashboard files without opening
a server, while `--no-dashboard` disables both.

Production acquisition remains a shared-runtime operation:

```bash
uv run --project ../Rotating-shield-simulation-runtime \
  rotating-shield-sim run-adaptive-session /private/physical-scenario.json
```

## MLE information planning

After a completed station, the MLE can rank runtime-supplied detector positions and
jointly choose a short Fe/Pb orientation program:

```python
planned = online_mle.plan_next_action(
    candidate_poses_xyz=runtime_candidates_xyz,
    travel_costs=runtime_travel_costs,
    planning_config=MLEPlanningConfig.load(
        "configs/mle/default_planning.json"
    ),
)
next_action = planned.selected_action
```

This is MLE-specific local Fisher `D_s`-optimal design, not the PF particle EIG rule.
Background and scatter are marginalized by a Schur determinant. The complete shield
program is selected jointly as one station block, while also marginalizing one
shared future station-rate nuisance. Thus complementary relative shield signatures,
not merely independently strong views, determine the ordered program. Zero MLE
regions remain represented by residual surface exploration modes. Direct floor/ceiling
response separation, alternative-support separation, z-Fisher information, response
correlation reduction, elevation diversity, and geometry exploration supplement the
local determinant. Candidate generation, collision filtering, local spatial
refinement, routes, and observation production stay in the shared runtime. The
selected action includes detector xyz plus an ordered
`measurement_program` with Fe/Pb indices, dwell times, and the final
`station_complete` flag.

The same operation is available for a saved station report:

```bash
uv run estimate-radiation-mle plan-next \
  --run-dir /path/to/measurement-log-v2 \
  --estimate /path/to/mle-online/stations/station_000003_step_00000015 \
  --mle-config configs/mle/default_spectral.json \
  --planning-config configs/mle/default_planning.json \
  --candidates /path/from/runtime/candidates.json \
  --output /path/to/next-mle-action.json \
  --cpu --json
```

The online dashboard served at its existing URL shows the latest recommendation and
marks its detector position. See [MLE information planning](docs/mle/information_planning.md)
for the criterion, candidate JSON contract, and limitations.

## RA-L full simulation

The physical RA-L profile is owned by the shared runtime; this repository now has a
strict launcher for runtime acquisition followed by spectral MLE replay. Verify the
complete Geant4/model/config chain without starting a long run:

```bash
uv run estimate-radiation-mle ral-full-simulation \
  --preflight-only --json
```

Run a private physical scenario under live MLE control and publish the dashboard:

```bash
uv run estimate-radiation-mle ral-full-simulation \
  --scenario /secure/runtime/ral-mix9-scenario.json \
  --output-dir /home/moeu/research/ral-runs/ral-mix9-mle \
  --json
```

Use `--run-dir` instead of `--scenario` to replay an existing completed RA-L
MeasurementLog. New acquisition uses `rotating-shield-sim run-adaptive-session`.
The online coarse MLE fits once after the current shield program closes its station;
intermediate spectra are buffered without changing the estimate. It can then ask the
runtime to refine promising 3-D candidate neighborhoods, rerank the returned
reachable poses, and select the next position and short Fe/Pb program. No station
count, view count, record count,
measurement route, or station list is fixed in advance. Source truth is never opened
by the MLE process.

The RA-L stop decision is compound: convergence/KKT, independent 3-D pose and height
coverage, elevation span, held-history deviance/map/cluster stability, response
correlation, floor/ceiling separation, systematic residuals, and a patience window of
low expected information gain must all pass. `--max-measurements` remains only a
safety bound.

See [RA-L full-simulation launcher](docs/mle/ral_full_simulation.md) for ownership,
persistent `tmux` execution, existing-log replay, and the adaptive-controller boundary.

## Final-log replay

Fit one authoritative cold spectral MLE from a finalized raw log:

```bash
uv run estimate-radiation-mle fit-spectrum \
  --run-dir /path/to/measurement-log-v2 \
  --mle-config configs/mle/default_spectral.json \
  --output-dir /path/to/mle-spectral \
  --cpu --json
```

The `replay` command is retained only for an explicitly derived count observation
contract. It does not derive isotope counts from raw MeasurementLog v2 spectra.

For a final unseen-environment evaluation after regularization and calibration have
been frozen:

```bash
uv run estimate-radiation-mle ral-holdout \
  --tuning-run-dir /path/to/independent-tuning-log \
  --holdout-run-dir /path/to/new-geant4-log \
  --mle-config configs/mle/ral_full_spectral.json \
  --output-dir /path/to/final-holdout-report
```

This command fails closed if run IDs, environment realization IDs, or environment
manifests are reused, if regularization is still being tuned, or if the final holdout
was used to calibrate model discrepancy.

Generated `build/`, `dist/`, `results/`, `images/`, caches, and root-level script
wrappers are intentionally absent. Use the installed `estimate-radiation-mle` entry
point rather than `main.py` or `mle_main.py`.

The IAS-era research workflow is preserved under `examples/legacy/`; its complete
pre-runtime source snapshot is also retained by the Git tag
`legacy-ias-mle-before-pf-runtime-import`. It is not imported by production code.

## Development

Python 3.12 and `uv` are required.

```bash
uv sync
uv run python scripts/check_repository_boundary.py
uv run pytest
```
