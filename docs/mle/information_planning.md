# MLE information planning

The MLE planner selects a detector station and a sequence of Fe/Pb shield
orientations after a station-complete spectral fit. It deliberately does not use
the particle-filter planner's particle expected-information-gain objective. The
implemented criterion is local Poisson Fisher `D_s`-optimal design under a Laplace
approximation around the current surface MLE.

## Ownership boundary

The shared runtime owns candidate generation, obstacle/traversability checks, route
construction, and travel-cost calculation. It supplies only truth-free candidate
positions and optional allowed shield-pair IDs. This repository evaluates those
candidates with the shared `ContinuousKernel`; it does not copy a simulator, map,
shield model, spectrum model, or PF state.

For `R` shared shield orientations, one pair ID follows the runtime convention:

```text
pair_id = fe_orientation_index * R + pb_orientation_index
```

The selected action contains a `measurement_program` whose rows give the pair ID,
Fe/Pb indices, live time, and `station_complete` flag. A runtime controller can map
those fields directly into its native acquisition actions and remains responsible
for durably staging every resulting `MeasurementRecord` before returning it to the
MLE.

The runtime publishes a nested Sobol sample of the true continuous free volume, with
head/mast/base collision checks and separately calculated motion, settling, and
shield-actuation costs. The MLE may return high-scoring candidate indices in a
generic refinement request. The runtime—not this package—generates and
collision-checks the local 3-D neighbors, after which the MLE reranks the refined
set. PF, MLE, and future estimators therefore share one physical workspace.

## Two-stage candidate search

The production planner separates candidate coverage from exact spectral ranking:

1. Every runtime pose is screened with a 64-group spectrum, a deterministic
   farthest-first subset of 16 Fe/Pb pairs, and a compact isotope-by-surface
   Fisher basis. Each source mode is represented by up to two spatial points.
   Zero fitted modes, including a zero Eu-154 estimate, remain present through
   area-weighted residual modes. The eight-view program is selected greedily in
   this approximate stage.
2. The screening leaders are sent to the runtime refinement API. Previously seen
   pose results stay in the causal planner cache, so the second screening pass
   evaluates only newly generated poses.
3. The best four poses are always evaluated exactly. A score tie can expand that
   set to at most eight, while a small spatial-diversity term keeps non-colocated
   alternatives. Only these poses use the complete spectrum, all allowed shield
   pairs, nuisance Schur complement, and eight-level beam search described below.

Screening does not change the MLE, observation physics, or exact evaluation of the
shortlist. Its approximation can only change whether the globally best runtime
candidate survives into that shortlist. Planning artifacts record both stages,
the exact candidate indices, cache reuse, and separate response/Fisher/beam times.

## Local source parameterization

The complete fitted surface can contain many patch/isotope coordinates. Directly
forming a dense Fisher matrix for all of them is unnecessarily expensive, while
keeping only nonzero MLE patches would make a sparse fit permanently blind to
unseen regions. The planner therefore builds a bounded local basis:

- the strongest fitted patch/isotope strengths get individual scaled modes;
- every remaining coordinate is retained in residual exploration modes grouped,
  in order of available capacity, by object, surface kind, or isotope;
- residual perturbations are distributed by physical patch area.

Consequently every patch/isotope coordinate contributes to at least one planning
mode, including coordinates whose current MLE is zero. The basis labels and scales
are written into every planning artifact.

## Expected Fisher criterion

Let `z` denote the reduced source modes and `eta` the fitted background/scatter
nuisance modes. For one candidate pose and shield pair, the shared line-resolved
response gives the expected spectrum `mu` and local Jacobian `J`. Its expected
Poisson Fisher information is

```text
F = J^T diag(1 / max(mu, mu_floor)) J.
```

The spectral response currently returns from the shared runtime as a float64 NumPy
array. Fisher contractions therefore stay in optimized CPU `einsum`, avoiding a
second full response transfer to CUDA. Historical response rows are retained across
causal prefixes, so only a newly acquired station is assembled. Historical Fisher
precision is also appended when the fitted source/nuisance state is unchanged; a new
MLE state invalidates it and triggers an exact full Fisher rebuild because every
Poisson denominator then changes. For planning bases of at least 24 parameters, all
candidate poses in a chunk share one eight-level CUDA beam sequence of exact float64
log-determinants. The 64-by-64 shield-pair rotation matrix is computed once per
planning call. Small bases remain on CPU because launch and transfer overhead
dominate. The planning artifact records response, Fisher, beam-search, cache modes,
and total elapsed time together with the selected backend.

Historical measurements are rebuilt with the same shared kernel. With stabilizing
Laplace precision `lambda I`, the current precision is

```text
P0 = lambda I + sum_historical F_m.
```

For any precision `P`, the source-only `D_s` value after marginalizing nuisance
parameters is

```text
psi(P) = logdet(P) - logdet(P_eta_eta).
```

This equals the log determinant of the source Schur-complement precision. For a
candidate program `A`, the reported information gain is

```text
IG(A) = 0.5 * [psi(P0 + sum_(a in A) F_a) - psi(P0)].
```

All views at one point can share an unknown multiplicative station-rate offset. For
each candidate row, the derivative with respect to its future log-rate is `mu`; the
planner augments the Fisher block with

```text
F_zs = sum_bins J
F_ss = sum_bins mu.
```

One rate parameter is shared by the entire candidate shield program and is included
in the nuisance Schur complement. This stops common absolute-count changes from
being mistaken for directional information.

Shield pairs at each pose are optimized as a complete ordered station program with a
bounded beam search, without repeating a pair. The checked-in default and RA-L
profiles select eight measurements per planned station. With beam width 64, the
planner retains the best 64 partial programs after each expansion instead of
enumerating every eight-pair permutation. Pair-specific vertical/support ambiguity
utility participates in this search instead of being added only after the shield
angles have already been chosen. The final station score is

```text
score = IG + mean_selected_pair_ambiguity_utility
           - motion_cost_weight * runtime_travel_cost
           - rotation_cost_weight * total_Fe_Pb_rotation_radians.
```

Both cost terms are disabled by default. Their weights have units of nats per unit
of the corresponding cost and must be calibrated for the acquisition platform.

## Vertical and support-ambiguity objectives

Local determinant gain can be large while two scientifically important hypotheses
remain almost indistinguishable. Every action therefore reports, and the planner can
weight, direct floor-versus-ceiling spectral separation, response-correlation
reduction, z-direction Fisher information, separation of recent alternative MLE
supports, source-relative elevation diversity, and early geometry exploration.

These terms use the complete surface dictionary or recent MLE fits, never PF
particles or PF candidates. They remain separate in the planning artifact so a large
aggregate score cannot hide vertical ambiguity. Candidate-density convergence is
tested across nested Sobol prefixes; one finite candidate set is not presented as an
exact continuous optimum.

This is a local design criterion, not a global Bayesian guarantee. It is most useful
after a stable station-complete fit. The residual modes, explicit ambiguity terms,
positive precision floor, and nuisance Schur complement make it safer than simply
ranking expected counts, but the result still depends on the current MLE and response
calibration.

## Runtime candidate JSON

The standalone CLI accepts this strict shell:

```json
{
  "candidate_poses_xyz": [[0.5, 0.5, 1.0], [1.5, 0.5, 1.0]],
  "travel_costs": [0.0, 1.25],
  "allowed_pair_ids": [0, 1, 8, 9],
  "current_pair_id": 0
}
```

Only `candidate_poses_xyz` is required. If `current_pair_id` is omitted, the last
causal measurement supplies it. The planner never accepts source truth, PF
particles, or PF candidates.

`plan-next` verifies that the saved MLE belongs to the runtime run and resolved MLE
configuration when those identities are present. Its covered step IDs must be an
exact prefix of the available log, and only that prefix contributes Fisher
information. Online planning is stricter still: it is available only when the
latest durable record closes a station and the latest fit covers all received
records.

Configuration defaults are in
[`configs/mle/default_planning.json`](../../configs/mle/default_planning.json).
